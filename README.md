# Git Basics

3 local stage + 1 remote:
1. Working directory
    * may or may not be managed by git, but git is aware of them
2. Staging area - pre-commit holding area
    * git index: a holding area for queueing up changes for the next commit
3. Commit - git repository (history in `.git` folder)
4. Remote repository

|Command|Description |
|--|--|
|`git status`|changes between: \|working directory\|staging area\| repository (`.git` folder)\|Remote|


The git repository:
1. Working directory (`~/projects/my-project`)
2. Repository (`/.git` --> hidden)

# General
configurations first:
```
git config --global user.name "username"
git config --global user.email "email"
```

|Command|Description|
|--|--|
|`git remote add origin <url>`|Adding remote to the repository|
|`git remote -v`|Shows the list of remotes|
|`git log`||
|`git alias`||
|`git init 'foldername to be created'`|shorten commands|

# Ignoring unwanted files and folders
Add unwanted files and folders name to `.gitignore` file.

|Example|Description |
|--|--|
|`myfile.txt`|specific file|
|`*.ext`|file pattern|
|`my-folder/`|folder|

* Note: adding `README.md` does not work. `git` does not ignore readme files even if you add it to `.gitignore`.

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

# Comparison
* Note: All comparisons are done for files **tracked** by git. If file is not in the list of git tracked files (`git ls-files`), the changes will not be shown.

## Setting vscode as difftool and mergetool
The way to wire them together is to modify your `.gitconfig` and you have two options.

1. To do this with command line entries, enter each of these:
```
git config --global merge.tool vscode
git config --global mergetool.vscode.cmd "code --wait $MERGED"
git config --global diff.tool vscode
git config --global difftool.vscode.cmd "code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE"
```
2. To do this by pasting some line in the `.gitconfig` with VS Code.

    * Run git `config --global core.editor "code --wait"` from the command line.
    * From here you can enter the command `git config --global -e`. You will want to paste in the code in the "Extra Block" below.
```
[user]
    name = EricDJohnson
    email = cool-email@neat.org

# Comment: You just added this via 'git config --global core.editor "code --wait"'
[code]
    editor = code --wait

# Comment: Start of "Extra Block"
# Comment: This is to unlock VSCode as your git diff and git merge tool    
[merge]
    tool = vscode
[mergetool "vscode"]
    cmd = code --wait $MERGED
[diff]
    tool = vscode
[difftool "vscode"]
    cmd = code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE
# Comment: End of "Extra Block"
```
Now in your git directory with a conflict, run `git mergetool` and you have `VSCode` helping you handle the merge conflict! To compare, run `git difftool`.

# Turning of the Default Prompt
|Command|Description |
|--|--|
|`git config --global diftool.prompt false`|By this setting, we will not have to deal with the prompt anymore.|
|`git config --global mergetool.prompt false`||
|`git config --global diftool.prompt false`|git will not keep `.orig` files after merge|

**Note**: After performing a merge, the original file with conflict markers can be saved as a file with a .orig extension.If this variable is set to false then this file is not preserved. Defaults to true (i.e. keep the backup files).

```
git merge <branch>

  *__*__* new branch
 /                           --->
/ master (no commits here)          /*__*__* master (new branch merged)

|`git tag --list`|shows the list of all tags|
|`git tag --delete <tag>`|removes the tag with name `<tag>`|

# Reset and Reflog
|Command|Description |
|--|--|
|`git reflog`|history of everything we have done|
|`git reset <commit_id>`|moves `HEAD` to the `<commit_id>`|

**Note**: `git reflog` is different with `git log` as it includes everything we have done. For example. `git log` does not show moving `HEAD` between different commits.

# Cherry-Pick
|Command|Description |
|--|--|
|`git cherry-pick <commit_id>`|cherry-pick a specific commit (`<commit_id>`|


# Rewriting History

## Update Last Commit
`git ammend` is the command to rewrite the history by changing the last commit or on your own branch at the public that no one has branched off of or is relying on the history of your branch.
Because once you change that commit history, you are going to create a huge conflict with anybody who is relying on that history.
**You definitely never want to do this on master.**

**Note**: Be careful of using `git ammend`. You only want to do this on a local branch 
|Command|Description |
|--|--|
|`git ammend`||
